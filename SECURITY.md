# Security Policy

## Overview

Security is a top priority for PinGuard. As a security scanning and remediation tool, we take the security of our software very seriously. This document outlines our security policy, how to report vulnerabilities, and what to expect when you report an issue.

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of PinGuard with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us directly at:

**security@pinGuard.dev** (when available)

Or create a [Security Advisory](https://github.com/reicalasso/pinGuard/security/advisories/new) on GitHub.

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within the following timeframes:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receipt
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates on investigation progress
- **Resolution Timeline**: Critical issues within 7 days, high severity within 14 days, medium severity within 30 days

## Security Response Process

1. **Receipt**: We confirm receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We assess the vulnerability and assign a severity level
3. **Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We coordinate disclosure with the reporter
5. **Release**: We release the fix and publish a security advisory

## Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation to root/admin
- Complete system compromise
- Data exfiltration of sensitive information

### High
- Significant privilege escalation
- Denial of service attacks
- Access to restricted files or systems
- Bypass of security controls

### Medium
- Information disclosure
- Local privilege escalation
- Authentication bypass
- Configuration vulnerabilities

### Low
- Minor information disclosure
- Issues requiring local access
- Theoretical vulnerabilities with limited impact

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep PinGuard Updated**
   - Always use the latest stable version
   - Subscribe to security advisories
   - Enable automatic updates where possible

2. **Secure Configuration**
   - Use strong authentication mechanisms
   - Limit network exposure
   - Regular security audits of configuration
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

3. **System Security**
   - Run PinGuard on hardened systems
   - Keep the host OS updated
   - Use proper file permissions
   - Monitor system logs

4. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Regular backups of configuration and data
   - Test backup restoration procedures
   - Secure backup storage

### For Developers

1. **Secure Development**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Regular security code reviews
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

2. **Testing**
   - Security unit tests
   - Integration security tests
   - Penetration testing
   - Fuzzing critical components

3. **Dependencies**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Vulnerability scanning of dependencies
   - Minimal dependency footprint
   - Pin dependency versions

## Security Features

PinGuard includes several built-in security features:

### Authentication and Authorization
- Role-based access control (future feature)
- API key authentication (future feature)
- Secure session management (future feature)

### Data Protection
- Encrypted data at rest (future feature)
- Secure communication channels
- Secure credential storage
- Data anonymization options

### System Security
- Privilege dropping where possible
- Secure file operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common attack vectors

### Audit and Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging
- Security event monitoring
- Audit trail maintenance
- Anomaly detection (future feature)

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Root Privileges**: PinGuard currently requires root privileges for full functionality
2. **Network Communication**: CVE data is fetched over HTTPS but API keys are stored in configuration files
3. **File Permissions**: Temporary files may have permissive permissions in some cases
4. **Database Security**: SQLite database may not be encrypted by default

### Planned Improvements

- [ ] Privilege separation architecture
- [ ] Encrypted configuration storage
- [ ] Certificate pinning for API communications
- [ ] Database encryption
- [ ] Security sandbox for scan operations
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Security event monitoring

## Compliance and Standards

PinGuard aims to comply with:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
- **CWE**: Common Weakness Enumeration
- **CVE**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

## Third-Party Security

### Dependencies

We regularly audit our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- Automated dependency scanning with `cargo audit`
- Regular updates to latest secure versions
- Monitoring of security advisories
- Replacement of vulnerable dependencies

### External Services

PinGuard interacts with:

- **NVD API**: National Vulnerability Database for CVE information
- **Package Repositories**: For package vulnerability information
- **Container Registries**: For Docker image distribution

All external communications use encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS).

## Security Tools and Automation

### Automated Security Scanning

- **Static Analysis**: Clippy and additional security linters
- **Dependency Scanning**: cargo-audit for known vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for Docker image vulnerabilities
- **Secret Scanning**: GitHub secret scanning enabled
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive test suite and coverage analysis

### Security Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Security-focused unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Security configuration testing
- **Fuzzing**: Planned for critical input processing
- **Penetration Testing**: Planned for stable releases
